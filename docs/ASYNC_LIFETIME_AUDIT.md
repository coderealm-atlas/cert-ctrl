# Asynchronous Lifetime & Ownership Audit

## Scope
A follow-up review was requested after fixing the AddressSanitizer leak uncovered by `LoginHandlerWorkflowTest.EndToEndDeviceRegistration`. The goal was to track other asynchronous components that use `std::enable_shared_from_this`, timers, or background threads, and verify that their lifetime management does not introduce additional leaks or use-after-free hazards.

## Methodology
- Grepped the repository for `shared_from_this`/`weak_from_this` usage and for destructors that perform logging or reference external resources.
- Manually inspected the primary asynchronous helpers and handlers:
  - `customio::Spinner`
  - `cjj365::IoContextManager`
  - `certctrl::LoginHandler`
  - `certctrl::UpdatesPollingHandler`
  - `client_async::HttpSession` (and pooled variants)
  - `beast_pool::ConnectionPool`
- Executed targeted ASAN tests after the review to confirm no regressions (`ctest -R LoginHandlerWorkflowTest.EndToEndDeviceRegistration --output-on-failure`).

## Findings
### 1. `customio::Spinner`
- Already patched to capture a `std::weak_ptr` and lock inside the timer callback.
- No further action required.

### 2. `cjj365::IoContextManager`
- Destructor no longer logs through `customio::IOutput`, avoiding the prior use-after-free.
- `stop()` joins threads safely; no additional shutdown logging observed.

### 3. `certctrl::LoginHandler`
- Uses `customio::Spinner` for polling feedback; lifetime now governed by the spinner fix.
- Polling loop finishes once a terminal status is observed, freeing captured lambdas.

### 4. `certctrl::UpdatesPollingHandler`
- `poll_loop` captures `shared_from_this()` to keep the handler alive during in-flight async work. Once `keep_running` is cleared the chain returns an already-resolved `IO<void>` and no additional callbacks are scheduled, so the shared pointer releases.
- Recommendation: document that callers must toggle `keep_running` (or reset the handler) to break the loop; otherwise the handler intentionally stays alive. A weak capture was considered but would require additional guards to avoid dereferencing a destroyed handler.

### 5. `client_async::HttpSession` & pooled variants
- Each async operation captures `shared_from_this()` to keep the session alive until completion. Operations propagate errors to a completion handler that either releases or recycles the session. Timers cancel outstanding work when they expire.
- No recursive re-arm of timers that would pin `shared_ptr`s indefinitely; callbacks always terminate after a request or timeout.

### 6. `beast_pool::ConnectionPool`
- Pool uses `std::shared_ptr<Connection>` entries; idle queues bound by `max_idle_per_origin` and `max_total_idle` caps.
- Async request path falls back to pool release or connection close in every branch (including error cases). No cycles detected between the pool and its connections beyond the intentional idle queue references.

### 7. Destructor Logging Review
- Apart from `IoContextManager`, no destructors log via objects they do not own. `CliCtx` still prints a debug message via the macro-based `DEBUG_PRINT`, which writes to `stderr` and is independent of custom outputs.

## Validation
- Rebuilt the AddressSanitizer preset and re-ran the workflow integration test to cover the previously failing path. No leaks or invalid accesses reported.
- Checked that no other tests in the ASAN suite reference the updates polling handler (test is currently disabled/not registered).

## Recommendations & Follow-ups
- **Documentation:** Capture these ownership expectations in component commentsâ€”especially for handlers meant to stay alive until a manual stop.
- **Broader Testing:** If an ASAN-targeted test for `UpdatesPollingHandler` becomes available, incorporate it into CI to cover long-poll paths.
- **Future Refactors:** When adding new async utilities, prefer weak captures for self-rearming timers (unless the workflow demands a persistent background component) and avoid destructor logging unless the logging sink lifetime is guaranteed.
