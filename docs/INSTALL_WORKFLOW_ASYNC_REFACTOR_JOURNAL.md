# Install Workflow Async Refactor Journal

## 2025-10-30
- Captured baseline plan in `docs/INSTALL_WORKFLOW_ASYNC_REFACTOR.md` and enumerated phased migration path.
- Implemented initial tracing hooks to aid debugging of the legacy workflow while refactor proceeds.

## 2025-10-31
- Added `InstallWorkflowRunner` skeleton under `src/handlers/install_workflow/` and registered it in `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Wired shared instances for `InstallConfigManager` and the new runner through the Boost.DI injector in `include/cert_ctrl_entry.hpp`.
- Updated `InstallConfigApplyHandler` to depend on the runner and delegate `start()` execution, preserving current behavior.
- Verified documentation references and ensured the runner mirrors existing copy action flow ahead of further async migration.
