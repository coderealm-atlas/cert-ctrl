# Object Lifetime Map

This document records how the main runtime objects in `cert-ctrl` are created, who owns them, and how long they stay alive. Use it as the source of truth when refactoring ownership or introducing new dependencies.

## Process-Level Singletons
| Component | Construction Site | Owner / Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cjj365::ConfigSources` | `RunCertCtrlApplication` (static local) | Stays alive for the lifetime of the process | Holds configuration search paths and profile data. Shared everywhere through DI by reference. |
| `certctrl::CliCtx` | `RunCertCtrlApplication` (static local) | Process lifetime | Captures CLI arguments and options. References are injected into handlers and helpers. |
| `customio::ConsoleOutputWithColor` (`output_hub`) | `App::start` (function-static) | Process lifetime | Backing implementation for `customio::ConsoleOutput`. Injected as `customio::IOutput` and shared across all components. |
| `certctrl::App<AppTag>` | `certctrl::launch` | Owned by `std::shared_ptr` held in `launch`; runs until shutdown | Coordinates DI setup, handler dispatch, and signal handling. |
| `cjj365::IoContextManager` | Injected via Boost.DI | Stored inside Boost.DI injector with default scope (`di::unique`); referenced by `App` until shutdown | Represents the global IO context pool. Stopped during `App::shutdown`. |
| `client_async::HttpClientManager` | Injected via Boost.DI | Stored inside Boost.DI injector (same scope as `IoContextManager`) | Starts worker threads on creation; stopped in `App::shutdown`. |
| `certctrl::InstallConfigManager` (DI bound) | Boost.DI binding in `App::start` (`di::singleton`) | Injector managed singleton; returned as `std::shared_ptr` | Used by DI-created components such as `InstallWorkflowRunner`. The singleton wrapper ensures a single shared instance within the App injector. |
| `certctrl::InstallWorkflowRunner` | Boost.DI binding in `App::start` (`di::singleton`) | Injector managed singleton | Holds a `std::shared_ptr<InstallConfigManager>` provided by DI. |

## Command-Scoped Handlers
| Component | Construction Site | Owner / Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `certctrl::HandlerDispatcher` | Boost.DI | Owned by `App::start`; lives for CLI session | Stores a `std::vector<std::shared_ptr<IHandler>>`. |
| `certctrl::ConfHandler`, `InstallConfigHandler`, `LoginHandler`, `UpdateHandler`, `UpdatesPollingHandler` | Boost.DI (via `vector<std::shared_ptr<IHandler>>`) | Shared pointers stored in `HandlerDispatcher`; lifetime matches dispatcher | Each handler receives dependencies via DI. `InstallConfigHandler` additionally creates its own manager instance (see below). |
| `certctrl::InstallConfigManager` (manual) | `InstallConfigHandler` constructor (`std::make_shared`) | Owned by `InstallConfigHandler`; destroyed when the handler is destroyed | Separate from the DI singleton. Created with runtime dir from `ConfigSources` and direct pointer to `HttpClientManager`. |

## Per-Operation Helpers
| Component | Construction Site | Owner / Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `install_actions::CopyActionHandler` | `InstallConfigManager::apply_copy_actions` (stack) | Stack-allocated per call | Uses a shared `FunctionResourceMaterializer` for the duration of the copy pipeline. |
| `install_actions::ImportCaActionHandler` | `InstallConfigManager::apply_import_ca_actions` | Stack allocation per call | Shares the same materializer pattern. |
| `install_actions::ExecActionHandler` | Created after copy/import stages inside `InstallConfigManager` | Stack allocation per call | Runs exec items associated with either copy or import phases. |
| `install_actions::FunctionResourceMaterializer` | Lambdas inside `apply_copy_actions` / `apply_import_ca_actions` | `std::shared_ptr` captured by async chain | Delegates materialization back into `InstallConfigManager`. |
| `install_actions::FunctionExecEnvironmentResolver` | Same as above | `std::shared_ptr` captured by async chain | Resolves environment variables at exec time. |
| `monad::IO` continuations (`then`, `catch_then`) | Inside handler and manager methods | Temporary state held by monad; lifetimes end when pipeline resolves | Ensure any captured objects are either value copies or `shared_ptr` to avoid dangling refs. |

## Lifetimes & Ownership Guidelines
- **Prefer DI singletons for cross-handler services.** `InstallConfigManager` is currently available both through DI and through manual construction. Aligning on one creation path avoids diverging state and makes ownership predictable.
- **Handlers own their bespoke dependencies.** The `InstallConfigHandler`-specific manager should either be sourced from DI or clearly documented (as above) to make its private lifetime explicit.
- **Async chains must never capture raw `this` unless the owner is managed by `shared_from_this()`.** Use `auto self = shared_from_this()` for objects that outlive the call stack (`InstallWorkflowRunner` already does this). Otherwise capture by value or use `std::weak_ptr` promotion patterns.
- **Factory helpers (`FunctionResourceMaterializer`, etc.) are intentionally short-lived.** Treat them as per-call utilities; they are safe to recreate on each invocation.

Keeping this map up to date will prevent future lifetime regressionsâ€”especially around the async monad pipelines where accidental dangling captures are the easiest way to end up with the kind of hard-to-reproduce failures we are chasing right now.
